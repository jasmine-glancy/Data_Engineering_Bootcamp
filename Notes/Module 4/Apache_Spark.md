| **Apache Spark**  | - Spark is a distributed compute framework that allows you to process very large amounts of data efficiently <br> &emsp;• The successor of Hadoop/ Java MapReduce<br><br>- **Benefits to Spark** <br> &emsp;• Spark leverages RAM much more effectively than previous iterations of distributed compute<br> &emsp;&emsp;• It's *way* faster than Hive/Java MR/etc<br> &emsp;• Spark is storage agnostic, allowing a decoupling of storage and compute<br> &emsp;&emsp;• Spark makes it easier to avoid vendor lock-in<br> &emsp;• Spark has a huge community of developers so StackOverflow/Chat GPT will help you troubleshoot <br><br>- **When Spark Isn't So Good**<br> &emsp;• Nobody else in the company knows Spark<br> &emsp;&emsp;• Spark is not immune to the bus factor<br> &emsp;• Your company already uses something else a lot<br> &emsp;&emsp;• Inertia is often times not worth it to overcome |
