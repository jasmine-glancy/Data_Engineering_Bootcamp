| **Signals of Tech Debt in Data Engineering**  | - Painful pipelines that break or are delayed<br>- Large cloud bills <br>- Multiple sources of truth<br>- Unclear data sets that aren't documented|
| **Path Forward for Painful Pipelines**  | - The only thing better than optimized is deprecated!<br>- Is there anything that can be done? <br> &emsp;• Migrate to new technology<br> &emsp;• Implement better data modeling<br> &emsp;• Bucketing?<br> &emsp;• Sampling?<br>- Deprecating without a replacement can be a hard sell!  |
