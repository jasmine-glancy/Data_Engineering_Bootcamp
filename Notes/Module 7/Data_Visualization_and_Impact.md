If you are **not** impacting decision-making as a data engineer, you are ***costing the company money!***

### Types of Impact You Can Have as a Data Engineer

1. Measurable
   - Your experiments changed a metric
   - You made a pipeline more efficient
2. Hard-to-measure
   - Quality improvements
   - Team enablement outcomes
   - "Nothing went wrong. Yay!"
3. Immeasurable
   - Changing intuitions
   - Team culture improvements
   - Being a "glue" person

### How Does Your Time As a Data Engineer Translate Into Value?

- Supplying insights
- Prevent bugs and maintain data trust
  - Data is less likely to be wrong than intuition
- Increase pipeline efficiencies
  - Efficient pipelines save time and increase responsiveness to data quality issues, making organizations more agile and able to respond quickly to change.
- Enabling other engineers to work faster
- Persuading decision makers to use data

### When is an Insight Valuable?

Insights do one of three things:

1. Reinforce intuitions
2. Contradict intuitions
3. Fail to support or contradict intuitions
   - Remember, no result IS a result!
   - Failing to reject the null hypothesis is still valuable!

**Supplying insights is often overvalued.** You know insights are being overvalued when:

- A "crisis" happens
  - i.e. a dip in numbers
  - If you are doing your data engineering right, the information slices should be available anyway
- You feel burnt out
- Long-term planning disappears
- Ad hoc request hell
  - You have so many requests coming in that you don't know which ones you need to prioritize

Do not overvalue insights while undervaluing tech debt and sanity!

### Pushing Back

How do you push back when insights are overvalued?

1. ***Don't be afraid to say "no"***
   - Saying "no" provides an opportunity to discuss priorities
   - It opens the possibility to have a conversation about sustainable work environment
   - It's important to push back on low-value requests to maintain focus on impactful work
2. Leverage your manager for support
3. Communicate that robust data models are better than one-off pipelines!
   - If you go slower making quality pipelines, you will make the process faster in the future

### Maintaining Trust in Data Sets You Produce

Maintaining trust in data ensures that decision-makers can rely on the data for accurate and confident decision-making, which is crucial for business operations.

- Quality checks
- Documentation
- Good engineering practices
- Clear expectations (i.e. SLAs, documented gaps)

*This type of value is often UNDERVALUED because it's harder to measure.*

### Increasing Pipeline Efficiencies

1. Proper data modeling!
2. Improve oncall processses!
3. Reduce data volumes
4. Picking the right tool for the job (i.e. migrations)
5. Simplifying model and reducing capabilities a little bit (think 80/20 rule)

### Communication & Visualization

Compelling data visualization can significantly enhance decision-making processes by making data more understandable and actionable for stakeholders.

Impact is crucial. As a data engineer, your time can translate into value by maintaining trust in your dataset, improving pipeline efficiencies, enabling other engineers to work faster, persuading decision-makers to use data, and supplying insights. You can increase the efficiency of your pipelines by utilizing proper data modeling, improving oncall processes, reducing data volumes, choosing the right tool for the job, and simplifying your models when possible.

Things like quality improvements, team enablement outcomes, and changing intuitions or a team's culture are difficult to measure, but they cause an impact! Remember that saying "no" helps open communication about priorities. Compelling and accessibly displayed data can help stakeholders make better-informed decisions.
