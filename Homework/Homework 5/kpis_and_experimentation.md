# Spotify's KPI and Experimentation

I started using Spotify 11 years ago. I always preferred it to radio applications such as Pandora because I like to have control over my playlist. However, when I first listened to my Discover Weekly playlist, it quickly became my favorite part of Spotify. It was clear the more I listened to this playlist, the more Spotify learned my preferences. I have found a lot of songs and bands I love because of this playlist. The yearly rewind is my favorite feature, and I spend the year thinking about what songs may pop up.

Initially, I was adding 1-2 songs per week from the Discover Weekly playlist. After several months of interacting with this playlist weekly, I added 3-5 songs per week from consecutive versions of this playlist on the best weeks. Now, it's a part of my weekly reset ritual to listen to my Discover Weekly playlist in full. If I am not vibing with a song by its chorus, I skip. 

What causes you to spend money on it?
